In our first week we’ll be taking a look at what a DevOps engineer is and does from a 10,000ft view. With the high-level overview of what DevOps is, we’ll also unpack some commonly used terms and introduce ourselves to industry standard tools often used in the field.
One of the tools we’ll be looking at and using quite closely is BASH (Bourne Again Shell). We’ll learn what bash is, why it’s used, some foundational knowledge to properly navigate through bash and some tricks of the trades to help us become power users. We’ll be looking at some common bash syntax and statements, along with their intention.
Before proceeding with this course, please ensure you have Git and Node installed on your machine. Lab machines should have both of these installed, so if you prefer to use your own machine, Git and Node is required to follow the lab material.
